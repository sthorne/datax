# Encryption at rest

`--enc-key <file>` makes a node encrypt everything Pebble writes to its
data directory — sstables, WAL, MANIFEST, OPTIONS — plus the periodic
metadata backup. The key file holds the 32-byte **store key**, as 32 raw
bytes or 64 hex characters (`openssl rand -hex 32 > store.key`). All
crypto is the Go standard library.

```sh
datax init --dir data1 --enc-key store.key ...
```

## Design

Encryption lives in `pkg/storage/enc` as a `vfs.FS` wrapper around
Pebble's filesystem interface, so Pebble itself is untouched and the
choice is per-node: replication carries logical KV data, never files, so
encrypted and plaintext nodes coexist in one cluster (encrypt a cluster
by rotating nodes through wiped, encrypted stores).

Two key levels:

- The **store key** (from `--enc-key`) only seals the key registry and
  the metadata backup with AES-256-GCM.
- **Data keys** encrypt file content. A fresh data key is minted and made
  active on every store open, bounding how much ciphertext any one key
  covers; old keys are kept in the registry so existing files stay
  readable.

The registry (`ENCRYPTION-REGISTRY` in the data dir) is
`"DXR1" | GCM nonce | AES-256-GCM(storeKey, JSON{active_key_id, keys})`,
written atomically. Its presence is what marks a store as encrypted.

Each file is `"DXE1" | data-key ID | 16-byte random IV`, then AES-256-CTR
ciphertext. The keystream counter is derived from the IV and the logical
offset, so random reads (`ReadAt`) never re-derive more than one block.
Details that matter for correctness and confidentiality:

- **`ReuseForWrite` never recycles.** Rewriting a recycled WAL under its
  original key+IV would reuse the CTR keystream — an actual plaintext
  recovery attack, not hygiene. The old file is removed and a fresh one
  (new IV, current data key) created. This forfeits Pebble's WAL
  recycling and is the dominant cost of encryption (see below).
- **`Fd()` passes through**, audited against Pebble v1.1.5: the fd is
  used only for flock, fadvise hints, fallocate and sync_file_range —
  syscalls that never read or write file content — and hiding it costs
  real WAL fsync latency (no preallocation). The audit must be repeated
  on any Pebble upgrade; an fd used for mmap would read ciphertext.
- `Stat` subtracts the 24-byte header; `SyncTo`/`Preallocate`/`Prefetch`
  offsets are shifted by it — Pebble's size bookkeeping sees logical
  sizes throughout.

## Opening a store: the validation matrix

| Store state | `--enc-key` | Result |
|---|---|---|
| registry present | correct key | opens; fresh data key minted |
| registry present | wrong key | refused: "encryption key does not match store" |
| registry present | none | refused: "--enc-key is required" |
| plaintext store exists | key given | refused — no silent in-place conversion |
| empty dir | key given | initializes encrypted |
| no registry | none | plaintext, exactly as before |

## Key rotation

- **Data keys** rotate themselves: every node start mints a new active
  key. Fully rewriting old files under new keys is not implemented
  (Pebble compactions gradually do it as a side effect).
- **Store key**, offline only:

  ```sh
  # stop the node first — a running node keeps sealing with the key it
  # loaded at startup
  datax debug rotate-enc-key --dir data1 --old-key store.key --new-key new.key
  ```

  This reseals the registry and metadata backup; data keys and file
  contents are untouched.

## Recovery tooling

`datax debug metadata --dir ... --enc-key store.key` unseals the sealed
metadata backup (magic `DXMB1`); `datax debug unsafe-recover` takes the
same `--enc-key`. Losing the store key means losing the store — there is
deliberately no escrow.

## What it costs

`bench kv` single node, 16 workers, 30s, same machine (AES-NI present),
plaintext vs encrypted:

| | plaintext | encrypted |
|---|---|---|
| mixed 95/5 | 14,305 ops/s, p50 986µs | 12,383 ops/s (−13%), p50 1.12ms |
| read-only p50 | 253µs | 249µs (no measurable overhead) |
| write-only p50 | 4.9ms | 5.9ms (+20%) |

The read path is free in practice — Pebble's block cache holds decrypted
blocks, so cache hits never touch the wrapper. The write cost is **not**
AES (encrypting a commit's bytes is microseconds): it is the loss of WAL
recycling. `ReuseForWrite` never recycles a ciphertext file, so every WAL
is freshly allocated and every fdatasync journals block-allocation
metadata; a recycled plaintext WAL overwrites already-allocated blocks
and its fdatasync is data-only. CockroachDB's encrypted Pebble disables
WAL recycling for the same reason. Recorded runs live in issue #27.

## Limitations

- Store-key rotation is offline (stop the node first).
- No re-encryption of old files under rotated data keys beyond natural
  compaction churn.
- The `LOCK` file and directory entries (file names, sizes) are not
  encrypted; file names are Pebble's numeric names and leak no user data.
- Keys live in memory unprotected (no mlock/HSM integration).
